For my meesterproef assignment i chose to work with Lyvup on the Praise app.


***

**The Lyvup Praise app helps teams to apply and develop skills they excell at, on the platform they can write compliments to their team members, take an assessment in which they can uncover their skills as well as set goals they wish to accomplish within their team.**

#### :thumbsup: Giving praise
Team members can give praise to eachother or multiple users, praise can be given on their goals as well or regular compliments.

#### :triangular_flag_on_post: Setting goals
Every user can also set goals, these can be tied to skills they wish to develop or apply while working with the team over a certain period of time.

# The assignment

The assigment consisted of two parts:

## redesigning the frontend 
> we were to enhance the current praise app with UX and styling as well as think of a strategy in which this version of the app could be stripped down for a lightweight version which could be passed around to other teams so that they might want to try out the "premium" version of the app. To learn what the app was supposed to do and what we could offer to our client this part of the assignemnt required from us to...
* Write Use Cases and Customer Journeys to know what using the app would look and feel like :heavy_check_mark:
* Enrich user interaction (with animations and UX prinicples) :heavy_check_mark:

a. Apply corporate identity in the application

b. make Front-End responsive

c. Optimalize UX

* Apply gamification to make the app more engaging :heavy_check_mark:

## The "lunchbox" :hamburger:
* Develop a "lunchbox"version of the app (better described as a lightweight demo version with less funtionality) :heavy_check_mark:
* Design an onboarding process which introduces the app to the user :heavy_check_mark:
* Allow users of the lunchbox to give feedback to the developers
* Implement member gets member functionality so users can invite other teams to use the lightweight app :heavy_check_mark:
* Design a newsletter template
